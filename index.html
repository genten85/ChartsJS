    <p>
      The fatality rate of COVID-19 is determined based on the number of deaths
      over number of cases. While the number of cases in the United States is
      low relative to other countries, there have been a relatively great number
      of reported deaths. It can be suggested countries with lower rates has
      greater cases but less deaths, which suggests in those countries, the
      disease is less deadly. It is however important to stress that the cases
      in these countries are not good estimates because each country has
      different methodologies in testing and confirming cases. In addition,
      there are people with mild cases who might have been turned away and
      unreported or people who have yet to seek medical attention. <br /><br />
